To Do
General:
    May want to improve readability with a new font
    the website on mobile isn't quite how I'd like it. I'll have to fix it in the future.
Race Pages:
    Add content to other pages. (Currently only Dwarf is populated)
Class Pages:
    Add content to other pages. (Currently only Barbarian is populated)
Spells Page:
    Add rest of spells.
    turn into array and use string interpolation
Feats Page:
    Add content (this will look like the Spells page, but with no filter)
    turn into array and use string interpolation
Level Up Pages:
    Add content (this may take some time.)
Stretch Goal:
    If time permits, add a system to save character information on this website.
    This will require some backend knowledge.
    At first, it will just have the user input the info.
    Eventually, I'd like it to calculate bonuses based on the level of the character and the Ability scores that were input.
    After that, I'd find a way to mash it up with the Level Up page so that it will update the user's character info as the user selects options after prompting it to level their character up.
