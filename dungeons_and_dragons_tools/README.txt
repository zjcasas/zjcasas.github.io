To Do
General:
    the website on mobile isn't quite how I'd like it. I'll have to fix it in the future.
	limit width so 4k displays don't look weird
Class Pages:
    Add content to other pages. (Currently only Barbarian, Bard, Cleric, and Druid are populated)
Spells Page:
    Add rest of spells.
Feats Page:
    Add rest of feats
Level Up Pages:
    Add content (Currently only Barbarian is populated)
Stretch Goal:
    If time permits, add a system to save character information on this website.
    This will require some backend knowledge.
    At first, it will just have the user input the info.
    Eventually, I'd like it to calculate bonuses based on the level of the character and the Ability scores that were input.
    After that, I'd find a way to mash it up with the Level Up page so that it will update the user's character info as the user selects options after prompting it to level their character up.
