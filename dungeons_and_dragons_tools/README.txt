To Do
General:
    Ensure mobile responsiveness is good
	limit width so 4k displays don't look weird
Class Pages:
    Add content to other pages. (Currently only Barbarian, Bard, Cleric, Druid, and Fighter are populated)
    Add divs around class specific h5's
    no hideable  description on PC
Race Page:
    no hideable  description on PC
Spells Page:
    Add rest of spells.
Feats Page:
    Add rest of feats
Level Up Pages:
    Add content (Currently only Barbarian is populated)
Stretch Goal:
    If time permits, add a system to save character information on this website.
    This will require some backend knowledge.
    At first, it will just have the user input the info.
    Eventually, I'd like it to calculate bonuses based on the level of the character and the Ability scores that were input.
    After that, I'd find a way to mash it up with the Level Up page so that it will update the user's character info as the user selects options after prompting it to level their character up.
