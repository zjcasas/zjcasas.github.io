This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere&#44; spells can't be cast&#44; summoned creatures disappear&#44; and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends&#44; the sphere moves with you&#44; centered on you.,Spells and other magical effects&#44; except those created by an artifact or a deity&#44; are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed&#44; it doesn't function&#44; but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.,"<span class=""dark"">Targeted Effects</span> &mdash; Spells and other magical effects&#44; such as magic missile and charm person&#44; that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.","<span class=""dark"">Areas of Magic</span> &mdash; The area of another spell or magical effect&#44; such as fireball&#44; can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic&#44; the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed.

For example&#44; a +1 long sword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical long sword. A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (For example&#44; if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere)&#44; the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.","<span class=""dark"">Magical Travel</span> &mdash; Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere&#44; whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location&#44; world&#44; or plane of existence&#44; as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spells&#44; temporarily closes while in the sphere.","<span class=""dark"">Creatures and Objects</span> &mdash; A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.","<span class=""dark"">Dispel Magic</span> &mdash; Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere.

You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura's effect.,"<span class=""dark"">Antipathy</span> &mdash; The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it&#44; the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target&#44; the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can't see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can't see it&#44; the creature is no longer frightened&#44; but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.","<span class=""dark"">Sympathy</span> &mdash; The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it&#44; the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so&#44; it can't willingly move away from the target. If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature&#44; the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect&#44; as described below.","<span class=""dark"">Ending the Effect</span> &mdash; If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it&#44; the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save&#44; the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition&#44; a creature affected by the spells is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.",,,,,,A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute&#44; afeeter which time it can be affected again.,,,,,

The eye can look in every direction.,As an action&#44; you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. There is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move&#44; but it can't enter another plane of existence.

Arcane Gate,conjuration,not cantrip,6th,sorceror warlock wizard,1 action,500 feet,Verbal&#44; Somatic,Concentration up to 10 minutes,You create linked teleportation portals that remain open for the duration. Choose two points on the ground that you can see&#44; one point within 10 feet of you and one point within 500 feet of you. A circular portal&#44; 10 feet in diameter&#44; opens over each point. If the portal would open in the space occupied by a creature&#44; the spell fails&#44; and the casting is lost.,The portals are two-dimensional glowing rings filled with mist&#44; hovering inches from the ground and perpendicular to it at the points you choose. A ring is visible only from one side (your choice)&#44; which is the side that functions as a portal.,Any creature or object entering the portal exits from the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each other; passing through a portal from the nonportal side has no effect. The mist that fills each portal is opaque and blocks vision through it. On your turn&#44; you can rotate the rings as a bonus action so that the active side faces in a different direction.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Arcane Lock,abjuration,not cantrip,2nd,wizard,1 action,Touch,Verbal&#44; Somatic&#44; Material (gold dust worth at least 25 gp&#44; which the spell consumes),Until Dispelled,You touch a closed door&#44; window&#44; gate&#44; chest&#44; or other entryway&#44; and it becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set a password that&#44; when spoken within 5 feet of the object&#44; suppresses this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise&#44; it is impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting knock on the object suppresses arcane lock for 10 minutes.,While affected by this spell&#44; the object is more difficult to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Armor of Agathys,abjuration,not cantrip,1st,warlock,1 action,Self,Verbal&#44; Somatic&#44; Material (a cup of water),1 hour,A protective magical force surrounds you&#44; manifesting as a spectral frost that covers you and your gear.

On a successful save&#44; the creature takes half damage&#44; but suffers no other effect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher&#44; the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
Astral Projection,necromancy,not cantrip,9th,cleric monk warlock wizard,1 hour,10 feet,Verbal&#44; Somatic&#44; Material (for each creature you affect with this spell&#44; you must provide one jacinth worth at least 1000 GP and one ornately carved bar of silver worth at least 100 GP&#44; all of which the spell consumes),Special,You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that plane). The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn’t need food or air and doesn’t age.,Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way&#44; replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you&#44; fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact&#44; you can find your way home. If the cord is cut—something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does—your soul and body are separated&#44; killing you instantly.,Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell&#44; your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord&#44; allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body&#44; nor do they persist when you return to it.,The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends&#44; the affected creature returns to its physical body&#44; and it awakens.,,,,,,The spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful dispel magic spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creature’s original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points&#44; the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact&#44; the cord pulls the creature’s astral form back to its body&#44; ending its state of suspended animation.,If you are returned to your body prematurely&#44; your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies&#44; usually by dropping to 0 hit points.,,,,
