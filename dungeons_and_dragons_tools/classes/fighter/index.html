					Description
				</h4>
				<section>
					<p>
						Fighters learn the basics of ali combat styles. Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.
					</p>
					<p>
						Not every member of the city watch, the village militia, or the queen's army is a fighter. Most of these troops are relatively untrained soldiers wilh only the most basic combat knowledge. Veteran soldiers, military officers, trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar figures are fighters.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but also much greater rewards&mdash;few fighters in the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic flame tongue sword, for example.

					Martial Archetypes
				</h4>
				<section class="classspecific">
					<p>
						Different fighters choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach.
					</p>
					<h5>
						<span class="turn">
							<i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i>
						</span>
						Champion
					</h5>
					<section>
						<p>
							The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this archetype combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows.
						</p>
						<h6>
							Improved Critical
						</h6>
						<p>
							Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.
						</p>
						<h6>
							Remarkable Athlete
						</h6>
						<p>
							Starting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency bonus (round up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you make that doesn't already use your proficiency bonus.
						</p>
						<p>
							In addition, when you make a running long jump, the distance you can cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Strength modifier.
						</p>
						<h6>
							Additional Fighting Style
						</h6>
						<p>
							At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style class feature.
						</p>
						<h6>
							Superior Critical
						</h6>
						<p>
							Starting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20.
						</p>
						<h6>
							Survivor
						</h6>
						<p>
							At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points left. You don't gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.
						</p>
					</section>
					<h5>
						<span class="turn">
							<i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i>
						</span>
						Battle Master
					</h5>
					<section>
						<p>
							Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master employ martial techniques passed down through generations. To a Battle Master, combat is an academic field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such as weaponsmithing and calligraphy. Not every fighter absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and artistry that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but those who do are well-rounded fighters of great skill and knowledge.
						</p>
						<h6>
							Combat Superiority
						</h6>
						<p>
							When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="dark">Maneuvers</span> &mdash; you learn three maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under "Maneuvers" below. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack.
						</p>
						<p>
							You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="dark">Superiority Dice</span> &mdash; You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.
						</p>
						<p>
							You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="dark">Saving Throws</span> &mdash; Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="dark">Maneuver save DC</span> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)
						</p>
						<h6>
							Student of War
						</h6>
						<p>
							At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of artisans tools of your choice.
						</p>
						<h6>
							Know Your Enemy
						</h6>
						<p>
							Starting at 7th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics ofyour choice:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Strength score
							</li>
							<li>
								Dexterity score
							</li>
							<li>
								Constitution score
							</li>
							<li>
								Armor Class
							</li>
							<li>
								Current hit points
							</li>
							<li>
								Total class levels (if any)
							</li>
							<li>
								Fighter class levels (if any)
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h6>
							Improved Combat Superiority
						</h6>
						<p>
							At 10th level, your superiority dice turn into d10s. At 18th level, the turn into d12s.
						</p>
						<h6>
							Relentless
						</h6>
						<p>
							Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1 superiority die.
						</p>
						<h6>
							Maneuvers
						</h6>
						<p>
							The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="dark">Commander’s Strike</span> &mdash; When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike.

						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="dark">Disarming Attack</span> &mdash; When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it’s holding.

						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="dark">Distracting Strike</span> &mdash; When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening.

						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="dark">Evasive Footwork</span> &mdash; When you move, you can expend one superiority die, rolling the die and adding the number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="dark">Feinting Attack</span> &mdash; You can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of you as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="dark">Goading Attack</span> &mdash; When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you.

On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="dark">Lunging Attack</span> &mdash; When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die to increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="dark">Maneuvering Attack</span> &mdash; When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one o f your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target o f your attack.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="dark">Menacing Attack</span> &mdash; When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="dark">Parry</span> &mdash; When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="dark">Precision Attack</span> &mdash; When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="dark">Pushing Attack</span> &mdash; When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 15 feet away from you.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="dark">Rally</span> &mdash; On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one superiority die to bolster the resolve o f one of your companions.

						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="dark">Riposte</span> &mdash; When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="dark">Sweeping Attack</span> &mdash; When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="dark">Trip Attack</span> &mdash; When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down.

						Eldritch Knight
					</h5>
					<section>
						<p>
							The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to all fighters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter's reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.
						</p>
						<h6>
							Spellcasting
						</h6>
						<p>
							When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells. See the <a href="../../spells" target="blank">spells</a> page for the wizard spell list.. <!--See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting-->
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="dark">Cantrips</span> &mdash; You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="dark">Spell Slots</span> &mdash; The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
						</p>
						<p>
							For example, if you know the 1st level spell shield and have a 1st level and a 2nd level spell slot available, you can cast shield using either slot.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="dark">Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher</span> &mdash; You know three 1st level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and evocation spells on the wizard spell list.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
						</p>
						<p>
							The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.
						</p>
						<p>
							Whenever you gain a level in this c1ass, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, or 20th level.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="Spellcasting Ability"></span> &mdash; Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="dark">Spell save DC</span> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="dark">Spell attack modifier</span> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

						<h6>
							Weapon Bond
						</h6>
						<p>
							At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.
						</p>
						<p>
							Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can't be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantiy to your hand.
						</p>
						<p>
							You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.
						</p>
						<h6>
							War Magic
						</h6>
						<p>
							Beginning at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.
						</p>
						<h6>
							Eldritch Strike
						</h6>
						<p>
							At 10th level, you learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature's resistance to your spells. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.
						</p>
						<h6>
							Arcane Charge
						</h6>
						<p>
							At 15th level, you gain the ability to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see when you use your Action Surge. You can teleport before or after the additional action.
						</p>
						<h6>
							Improved War Magic
						</h6>
						<p>
							Starting at 18th level, when you use your action to cast a spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.
