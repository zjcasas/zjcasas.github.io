					Description
				</h4>
				<section>
					<p>
						In the worlds of D&D, words and music are not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with power all their own. The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.
					</p>
					<p>
						The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes fram a distance. But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric knowledge.
					</p>
					<p>
						True bards are not common in the world. Not every minstrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal court is a bard. Discovering the magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot the difference between these performers and true bards, though. A bard's life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.
					</p>
					<p>
						Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire to travel&mdash;to find new tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the horizon&mdash;makes an adventuring career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves.

					Bard Colleges
				</h4>
				<section class="classspecific">
					<p>
						The way of a bard is gregarious. Bards seek each other out to swap songs and stories, boast of their accomplishments, and share their knowledge. Bards form loose associations, which they call colleges, to facilitate their gatherings and preserve their traditions.
					</p>
					<h5>
						<span class="turn">
							<i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i>
						</span>
						College of Lore
					</h5>
					<section>
						<p>
							Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.
						</p>
						<p>
							The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.
						</p>
						<p>
							The college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.
						</p>
						<h6>
							Bonus Proficiencies
						</h6>
						<p>
							When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.
						</p>
						<h6>
							Cutting Words
						</h6>

							Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creatare that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can't hear you or if it's immune to being charmed.
						</p>
						<h6>
							Additional Magical Secrets
						</h6>
						<p>
							At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you call cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for yuu but don't count against the number of bard spells you know.
						</p>
						<h6>
							Peerless Skill
						</h6>
						<p>
							Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after rou roll the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you whether you succeed or fail.

					<h5>
						<span class="turn">

						College of Valor
					</h5>
					<section>
						<p>
							Bards of the Cullege of Valor are daring skalds whose tales keep alive the memory of the great heroes of the past, and thereby inspire a new generatiom of heroes. These bards gather in mead halls or around great bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present. They travel the land to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of those events doesn't pass from the world. With their songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.
						</p>

							Bonus Proficiencies
						</h6>

						</h6>
						<p>
							Also at 3rd level, you learn to inspire others in battle. A crcature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon damage roll it just made. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it hits or misses.
						</p>
						<h6>
							Extra Attack
						</h6>
						<p>
							Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
						</p>
						<h6>
							Battle Magic
