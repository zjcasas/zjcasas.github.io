To Do
General:
    May want to improve readability with a new font
    Add images to each page
    Add indication that many data fields are collapsible
    Add collapse all and expand all buttons to each page
    Improve the overall look and feel of the website, especially the Landing Page
    Make all pages responsive
Landing Page:
    Add info about spells, feats, and leveling up
Race Pages:
    Add content to other pages. (Currently only Dwarf is populated)
Class Pages:
    Add content to other pages. (Currently only Barbarian is populated)
Spells Page:
    Add rest of spells.
    The filtering system I created seems pretty hacky. Maybe find a better way to do this.
    Decide on whether or not to change the text of the Level filter when one or more levels are deselected.
Feats Page:
    Add content (this will look like the Spells page, but with no filter)
Level Up Pages:
    Add content (this may take some time.)
    Step 1. User selects a class. A list based off of the level information table for that class will appear.
    Step 2. User selects a class. A list of instructions to level up to each level will appear.
    Step 3. User selects a class and new level. A walkthrough of the changes for the chosen level will appear step by step.
Stretch Goal:
    If time permits, add a system to save character information on this website.
    This will require some backend knowledge.
    At first, it will just have the user input the info.
    Eventually, I'd like it to calculate bonuses based on the level of the character and the Ability scores that were input.
    After that, I'd find a way to mash it up with the Level Up page so that it will update the user's character info as the user selects options after prompting it to level their character up.
